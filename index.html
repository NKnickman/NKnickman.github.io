                        A prototype for ultra fast voxel terrain generation using Unity's burst compiler and job systems.
                        This video showcases a slower test where around 16 levels of detail are generated around the viewer.
                        Each level of detail beyond the second is about twice the size as the last, this exponential growth allows for very far render distance.

                        Here's a faster test generating around 13 levels of detail. It's important to note that the generation makes heavy use of multi-threading.
                        Voxel weight generation is executed per voxel as an IJobParallelFor, whilst the meshing process is done per chunk in an IJobParallelFor.

                        This system was originally intended for a restaurant management game. Essentially what's happening is the wall segments are being used as sides to solve the ear clipping algorithim.
                        This lets you generate floors for any room shape. I've also incorporated systems for other meshes to be inserted along the wall segments, this allows for placement of doors and windows.

                        Showcased here are the two main classes used in generating floor meshes from wall segments. Essentially the 3D mesh information is converted to 2D where the ear clipping algorithim is then applied and converted back to 3D to serve as generated mesh data.
