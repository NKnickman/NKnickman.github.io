    !!! quote "About"

        One of my most recent and favorite character models. This humanoid was designed for a CRPG project of mine. I'd painted over the normal maps to create a subtle "brushed effect". This is an early version of the game's protagonist.

        ![Deformation C](assets/media/brushed_humanoid/deformation_3.png)

    !!! quote "About"

        Here I've posed the character model in a few different ways. I was able to really refine the deformation and weight painting on this one, using the movement of multiple bones in some cases (e.g. shoulder bone and upper arm bone) to create better deformation and a more anatomically accurate pose.

        In the "Deformation" poses, you can see the ability of the model to stretch whilst maintaining good deformation.

    === "360 View"

        ![type:video](assets/media/electric_guitar/video.mkv)

    !!! quote "About"

        A stylized electric guitar model for the CRPG project mentioned earlier. All of the essential elements of a functioning electric guitar are visually represented and have accurate proportions. It is low poly and can be used in game engines.
    </div>

=== "Topology"

    <div class="grid" markdown>
    ![Topology](assets/media/electric_guitar/topology.png)

    !!! quote "About"

        Subdivision surface was employed often to create the normal maps for the guitar, the topology conforms to the angles built into the design of the guitar. The triangle count for this model is 5,612. A good amount of detail was given to this prop as it will be an important and closely examined item in the game.

## Wasteland RPG Character Assets
=== "Facial Expressions"

    <div class="grid" markdown>
    === "Face 1"

=== "Facial Expressions"

    <div class="grid" markdown>

    === "Face3"
    
        ![Face 3](assets/media/cartoony_humanoid/face3.png)

    !!! quote "About"

        I'm very happy with the overall look of the model, especially in the face. I'd never really experimented with unlit shading before this point and it gave me a lot more artistic freedom when representing the shading. For how low the poly count is, the facial expressions look quite good, I really think I polished this one well.
