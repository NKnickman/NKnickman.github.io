        ![Face 3](assets/media/multipurpose_humanoid/face3.png)

    !!! quote "About"

        This character model was designed for use in a game where NPC interaction was considered very important. The character model is able to give a range of expressions using both facial bone and blend shape animation.

        Topological showcase, this model is one of the higher poly models I've created.

        ![Layer 2](assets/media/anatomical_humanoid/body_figure.png)

    !!! quote "About"

        This model was made for a fantasy RPG I planned to develop. As you can see there are three main layers to this model: the skeleton layer, muscle layer, and body layer.

    !!! quote "About"

        Here's a showcase of the topology, as you can see it's very low-poly which makes for quite good performance in-engine.
    </div>

        Topology of the anatomical bear model. This is another low poly model and has even less polygons than the anatomical humanoid.

## Cartoony Character Assets
=== "Base Pose"

    <div class="grid" markdown>
    ![T-Pose](assets/media/cartoony_humanoid/tpose.png)

    !!! quote "About"

        A cartoony character model for use in game engines, the triangle count is very low (less than 4 thousand).
    </div>

=== "Facial Expressions"

    <div class="grid" markdown>
    === "Face 1"
    
        ![Face 1](assets/media/cartoony_humanoid/face.png)
   
    === "Face 2"
    
        ![Face 2](assets/media/cartoony_humanoid/face2.png)

    === "Face3"
    
        ![Face 3](assets/media/cartoony_humanoid/face3.png)

    !!! quote "About"

        I'm very happy with the overall look of the model, especially in the face. I'd never really experimented with unlit shading before this point and it gave me a lot more artistic freedom when representing the shading. For how low the poly count is, the facial expressions look quite good, I think this is one of the most polished models I've made.

=== "Topology"

    <div class="grid" markdown>
    === "Torso"
    
        ![Topology 1](assets/media/cartoony_humanoid/wireframe1.png)
   
    === "Face"
    
        ![Topology 1](assets/media/cartoony_humanoid/wireframe2.png)

    !!! quote "About"

        Topology of the model.
