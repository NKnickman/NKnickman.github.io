Hey there! My name's Nate and I've been making games since 2019. On this website I've showcased some of the best work I've done during that time. I specialize in 3D art and programming, but have experience with many other components of game development such as: music composition, UI design, and networking for multiplayer games.

You can use the navigation options on this site to take a look at my work!
